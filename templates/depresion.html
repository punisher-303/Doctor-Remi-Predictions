                        Depression is a mental health disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, loss of
                        interest or pleasure in activities, and a range of physical and emotional symptoms. It is a
                        common condition that can affect anyone, regardless of age, gender, or background.There are
                        several different types. Depression is treatable — usually with talk therapy, medication or
                        both. Seeking medical help as soon as you have symptoms is essential.

            <h1>Symptoms : </h1>
            <ul style="margin: 9px 0px 30px 30px;">
                <li> Persistent sadness: A deep and persistent feeling of sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness. </li>
                <li> Loss of interest or pleasure: Decreased interest or pleasure in previously enjoyed activities,
                    hobbies, or social interactions.</li>
                <li> Changes in appetite and weight: Significant changes in appetite, leading to either weight gain or
                    weight loss. </li>
                <li> Sleep disturbances: Insomnia (difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or early morning
                    awakening) or hypersomnia (excessive sleepiness or prolonged sleep).

                </li>
                <li> Fatigue or loss of energy: Persistent feelings of tiredness, lack of energy, or reduced stamina.
                    Even small tasks may feel exhausting and overwhelming.

                </li>
                <li> Difficulty concentrating: Trouble concentrating, making decisions, or remembering details.
                    Cognitive abilities and mental processing may feel slowed down.</li>
                <li> Suicidal thoughts or behaviors: In severe cases, individuals with depression may experience
                    thoughts of death, self-harm, or suicide. It's important to take these signs seriously and seek
                    immediate help.</li>

            <h1>Causes : </h1>
            <ul style="margin: 9px 0px 30px 30px;">
                <li>Biological differences. People with depression appear to have physical changes in their brains. The
                    significance of these changes is still uncertain, but may eventually help pinpoint causes.</li>
                <li>Brain chemistry. Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that likely play a role
                    in depression.</li>
                <li>Hormones. Changes in the body's balance of hormones may be involved in causing or triggering
                    depression.</li>
                <li>Inherited traits. Depression is more common in people whose blood relatives also have this
                    condition. </li>
                <li>Environmental factors: Certain life events or experiences can trigger or contribute to depression.
                </li>
                <li>Problems such as social isolation due to other mental illnesses or being cast out of a family or
                    social group can contribute to the risk of developing clinical depression.</li>
                <li>Substance misuse: Nearly 30% of people with substance misuse problems also have major or clinical
                    depression.</li>
                <li>Sadness or grief after the death or loss of a loved one, though natural, can increase the risk of
                    depression.</li>
            </ul>
