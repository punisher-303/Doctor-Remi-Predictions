                        A cataract is a common eye condition characterized by the clouding of the natural lens inside
                        the eye, leading to vision problems. The lens, located behind the iris (colored part of the
                        eye), helps focus light onto the retina, allowing clear vision. However, when a cataract forms,
                        the lens becomes cloudy, impairing the passage of light and causing blurry or distorted
                        vision.Cataracts typically develop gradually and are most commonly associated with aging. They
                        are more prevalent among older adults, but they can also occur in younger individuals due to
                        various factors, such as genetics, trauma, certain medications, medical conditions like
                        diabetes, and prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation.

            <h1>Causes : </h1>
            <ul style="margin: 9px 0px 30px 30px;">
                <li>Aging: Age-related changes in the proteins within the lens of the eye are the most common cause of
                    cataracts. As we age, the lens becomes less flexible, less transparent, and more prone to clouding.
                </li>
                <li>Genetics: Cataracts can run in families, suggesting a genetic predisposition. Certain genetic
                    mutations or conditions may increase the likelihood of developing cataracts at an earlier age or in
                    a specific pattern.</li>
                <li>Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation: Chronic and unprotected exposure to sunlight and
                    other sources of UV radiation, such as tanning beds, may contribute to the development of cataracts
                    over time.</li>
                <li>Diabetes: People with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing cataracts. Elevated blood sugar
                    levels can affect the clarity and health of the lens, leading to cataract formation.</li>
                <li>Smoking and alcohol consumption: Smoking and excessive alcohol consumption have been associated with
                    an increased risk of cataracts.</li>
                <li>Eye injuries or trauma: Trauma to the eye, such as blunt force, penetrating injuries, or previous
                    eye surgery, can increase the likelihood of developing cataracts.</li>
                <li>Certain medications: Long-term use of certain medications, such as corticosteroids, may increase the
                    risk of cataracts. These medications can affect the metabolism and health of the lens.</li>
                <li>Congenital or developmental factors: Some individuals may be born with or develop cataracts during
                    childhood due to genetic abnormalities, intrauterine infections, or other developmental factors.
                </li>

            <h1>Precautions : </h1>
            <b>While cataracts cannot be entirely prevented, certain precautions and lifestyle measures can help reduce
                the risk of developing cataracts or slow their progression. Here are some precautions you can take:

            </b><br><br>
            <ul style="margin: 9px 0px 30px 30px;">
                <li>Protect your eyes from UV radiation: Wear sunglasses that block 100% of both UVA and UVB rays when
                    you are outdoors, particularly in bright sunlight. Also, consider wearing a wide-brimmed hat or
                    visor for additional protection.</li>
                <li>Quit smoking: Smoking has been linked to an increased risk of cataract development. Quitting smoking
                    can help lower your risk and improve overall eye health. </li>
                <li>Manage chronic health conditions: Properly manage chronic health conditions like diabetes and
                    hypertension by following your healthcare provider's recommendations. Keeping your blood sugar
                    levels and blood pressure under control can help reduce the risk of cataracts.</li>
                <li>Eat a healthy diet: Include a variety of fruits, vegetables, and foods rich in antioxidants in your
                    diet. Antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, found in foods like citrus fruits, berries, leafy
                    greens, and nuts, may help protect the eyes from oxidative stress.</li>
                <li>Maintain a healthy weight: Obesity and excessive weight gain have been associated with an increased
                    risk of cataracts. Aim to maintain a healthy weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise.
                </li>
                <li>Limit alcohol consumption: Excessive alcohol consumption has been linked to an increased risk of
                    cataracts. If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation.</li>

            </ul>
